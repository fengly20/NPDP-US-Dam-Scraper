# NPDP US Dam Scraper

The scraper extracts US dam information from [NPDP ( National Performance of Dams Program ) dams database](http://npdp.stanford.edu/dams_database). 

The code is designed for my purposes and revise will be needed for other similar use. 

The code is not totally robust if the html_file read in from any of urls is not as expected. 

## Known issues: 

1. the [url http://npdp.stanford.edu/data_access/international_dams_view.php?editid1=NPDPUSA0029068#](http://npdp.stanford.edu/data_access/international_dams_view.php?editid1=NPDPUSA0029068#) does not return a dam page and stops the for loop.
